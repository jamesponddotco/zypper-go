# zypper-go

`zypper-go` is a wrapper for the `zypper` package manager that provides
a convenient Go interface for common operations.

**It's a very early work in progress and is not yet ready for use, as
I'm not yet sure what the final API will look like. Heck, you might call
it experimental and I might never finish it.**
